**\*\*NOTE:\*\* for the external API, please switch branches to 'retrieving-api-data' and go to [this repository](https://github.com/mluo24/sharefolio-frontend/tree/retrieving-api-data) for the frontend**


This project was originally made as a passion project/to test out Django, and it was partially extended for my high school senior project but was canceled due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

## Details

Make your creative portfolio and share it with others and receive feedback, all in one community!

As of right now, it is an app for sharing original works of (chaptered) fiction (think Wattpad/Archive of Our Own). In the future, this project hopes to see more forms of mediums being added in, most notably photos/artworks, as well as more fleshed out community/constructive feedback features.

## Features
Currently, this app supports the following:
- User signup/login/profiles
- Posting new stories, adding chapters to stories
- Draft/published and ongoing/completed system
- Comments on stories
- Categories and tags

Some planned features include:
- Follower system
- Better liked system
- Images (and more!) as an art medium
- Filter by tags
- Better look

## Installation (to try it out)

Coming soon!
